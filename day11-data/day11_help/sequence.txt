Why multi tasking ?
Process based vs Thread based 
What is a Thread ?
Thread state Transitions
Thread API
Creating a thread using lambda expression
Thread t1=new Thread(() -> sop(Thread.currentThread().getName()),"my_thrd");

Testing concurrency n applying threads
Objectives
1. Testing async behavior(concurrency) using extends Thread
eg : public class MyThread extends Thread
{
   //add a parameterized ctor : to supply name of the thrd
//override : run --- for loop (sleep)--delay loop
}

Tester : main : main thread
create multiple threads n start them

Regarding method overriding n exception handling
Overriding or implementing form of the method 
CAN NOT throw any NEW OR BROADER CHECKED excs.
 

2nd Objective : Refer to whiteboard(even printer ,odd printer ...)


3rd objective : sorting of the maps(refer to whiteboard)

Go through joint account scenario, from the whiteboard .





Enter synchronization (=applying thread safety)
