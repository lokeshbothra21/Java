Revise Multi threading basics
Synchronization
Thread un safe collections
Inter Thread communication


1. What will happen if you don't implement run() method in implements scenario
javac error!

2. What will happen if you don't override run() method in extends scenario
no error ! , in effective thread(do nothing thread , since inherits blank run() from Thread class
3. What will happen if you invoke run() method instead of start ?
no error ,BUT fatal error => no multi threading , i.e all the tasks will be executed by the main thread!

4. What will happen if you call start() on a runnable thread?
Invoker thrd gets IllegalThreadStateExc

5. What will happen if you call start() on a dead thread?
Invoker thrd gets IllegalThreadStateExc
6. Name the un blocking triggers for a thread blocked on sleep?
sleep over | interrupt
7. Name the un blocking triggers for a thread blocked on read?
data available! (while using java.io)

6. Name the un blocking triggers for a thread blocked on join?
specified thread over | interrupt | time out

Refer to join account scenario , complete it n test !

Refer to synchronization


eg code for getting random no
Random r1=new Random();
int nextRandomInt=r1.nextInt();
